# By opting for auto, it will automatically apply performance for the X and Y
# axes and silent for the Z axis and extruder. autoswitch is an highly
# experimental choice that enables dynamic switching between silent and
# performance modes in real-time when needed. However, at the moment, this
# transition can potentially be troublesome, resulting in unwanted behavior,
# noise disturbances and lost steps. Hence, it is recommended to avoid using
# 'autoswitch' until its identified issues are fully addressed
