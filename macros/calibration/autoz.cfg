[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position: 206.5,307
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the z endstop.

switch_xy_position: 201.5,289
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on
#   the z endstop.

#switch_xy_offsets: optional when switch_xy_position is used
#   Instead of an absolute position (switch_xy_position), this configuration
#   adds an X, Y offset (e.g. -6,-18) to the nozzle position.

bed_xy_position: 150,150
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates are adjusted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the zero_reference_position which
#   replaces the deprecated relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the zero
#   reference position at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.

switch_offset: 0.489 #0.316 #0.409 #0.309 #0.259 #0.159 #0.379 # 50 #0.68
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   A larger value will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   This must be determined manually. More on this later
#   in this section..

offset_margins: -2.0,1.0
#   The minimum and maximum margins allowed for the calculated offset.
#   If the offset is outside these values, it will stop!
#   The margin can be defined as "min,max" e.g. "-0.5,1.5" or by just one
#   value e.g. "1.0" which translates to "-1.0,1.0" (which is also the default).

speed: 120
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.

probing_speed: 2
    #default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is enabled. The default is from the Z rail configuration.

#probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.

probing_first_fast: false
#   If true, the first probing will be faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get down faster and not record the result as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.

start_gcode: ATTACH_PROBE
#   A list of G-Code commands to run before each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.

before_switch_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to run before to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can
#   be used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.

end_gcode: DOCK_PROBE
#   A list of G-Code commands to run after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for the G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
